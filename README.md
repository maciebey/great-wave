# Great Wave â€“ Multi-Layered Image Manipulator

Inspired by the techniques used to create wood print art such as the iconic piece "The Great Wave of Kanagawa" by Hokusai, this project allows users to manipulate specially crafted image layers to create new variations.

Tech: React, Typescript

This project is currently in a working proof of concept state. Planned features (ordered from most to least priority):
- Deploy to Github Pages (or similar), link to in README
- Replace POC images with initial set
- Flatten and Export creation to file
- Undo/Redo of changes
- Additional manipulation settings
- Add additional image set(s), and create switcher
- Locally cache user selections, restore on reload
- Locally save versions, restore and switch
- STRETCH: export to 3rd party print service
